Code analysis can help analysts identify the techniques and methods used by the malware to evade detection and develop effective countermeasures.</li>
<li>Behavior analysis: Although behavior analysis is not strictly a static analysis technique, it can be used in conjunction with static analysis to provide a more complete understanding of the malware. Behavior analysis involves studying the behavior of the malware on a system, such as the files it creates or modifies, the registry keys it alters, and the network connections it makes. This can help analysts understand the capabilities of the malware and identify any potential damage it may cause. These are just a few examples of the many static analysis techniques that can be used to analyze malware. </li>
<li>String analysis: This technique involves searching for specific strings or sequences of characters within the malware’s code. These strings may include URLs, IP addresses, or other identifying information that can help analysts identify the malware’s command-and-control servers or other malicious activities.</li>
<li>Control flow analysis: This technique involves examining the flow of control within the malware’s code, such as the sequence of instructions executed during program execution. Control flow analysis can help analysts identify potential vulnerabilities or exploits within the malware’s code, as well as understand the overall structure and functionality of the malware.</li>
<li>Debugging: Debugging involves examining the behavior of the malware while it is running in a controlled environment, such as a debugger or virtual machine. This can help analysts identify the malware’s behavior and functionality in real-time, as well as identify any anti-debugging or anti-forensic techniques used by the malware.</li>
<li>File format analysis: Some malware samples may be embedded within other files, such as documents or executables. File format analysis involves examining the structure and format of these files in order to identify any embedded malware or malicious code.</li>
<li>Metadata analysis: Metadata analysis involves examining the metadata associated with a malware sample, such as its file size, creation date, and digital signature. This can help analysts identify the origin of the malware, as well as any potential indicators of compromise (IOCs) that can be used to detect and prevent similar malware in the future. </li>
<li>Code obfuscation analysis: Code obfuscation is a technique used by malware authors to hide the true nature of the malware’s code, making it harder to analyze and detect. Code obfuscation analysis involves examining the malware’s code to identify any obfuscation techniques used, and then attempting to decode or deobfuscate the code to reveal its true nature.</li>
<li>API analysis: APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are interfaces that allow software components to interact with each other. Malware often uses APIs to interact with the operating system or other software components. API analysis involves identifying the APIs used by the malware and understanding how they are used, which can provide insight into the malware’s behavior and functionality.</li>
<li>Function call analysis: Function call analysis involves examining the functions called by the malware, and understanding how they are used to carry out the malware’s behavior. This can help analysts identify the malware’s capabilities and potential impact on the infected system.</li>
<li>Code reuse analysis: Code reuse analysis involves identifying whether the malware reuses any code or functionality from other known malware samples. This can help analysts identify the malware’s author or group, and also help with the development of effective countermeasures.</li>
<li>Control and data flow analysis: Control and data flow analysis involves examining the flow of data and control within the malware’s code. This can help analysts identify how the malware moves through a system, and what data it accesses or modifies. </li>
<li>Packing analysis: Packing is a technique used by malware authors to compress or encrypt the malware’s code in order to evade detection by antivirus software. Packing analysis involves identifying whether the malware is packed, and if so, which packing technique is used. This can help analysts determine the true nature of the malware’s code and develop effective countermeasures.</li>
<li>Symbolic execution: Symbolic execution is a technique used to analyze the behavior of a program by executing it with symbolic inputs rather than concrete ones. This can help analysts understand how the malware’s code behaves under different conditions, and identify any potential vulnerabilities or exploits.</li>
<li>Cross-referencing analysis: Cross-referencing analysis involves examining the malware’s code to identify references to specific files, registry keys, or other system resources. This can help analysts understand the malware’s behavior and potential impact on the infected system.</li>
